                <h1>Leakage Localization Project</h1>
                <p>In summer 2015 I began a colloaboration with the Civil Engineering Department at the Indian Institute of Science, studying applications of machine learning to construction and maintenance of water distribution networks. We have recently been comparing the accuracy of support vector machine, artificial neural network, and random forest classifiers on the task of locating leaks in water networks. We are training classifiers to recognize leaks at various junctions in the network based on the pressure and flow signatures in pipes.
