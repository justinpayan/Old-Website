                <p>My name's Justin Payan. I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at UMass Amherst. 
                My interests are in NLP and network theory, generally. I recently received my Bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Cognitive Science, as well as a Master's degree
                    in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Georgia. Prior to my PhD, I also worked at
                    <a href="https://www.vertica.com/">Vertica</a>, as a software engineer
                    on the Machine Learning team.
                </p>
                <p>
                My master's thesis is on <a href="KeywordExtraction.html">keyword extraction</a>.
                Some other past projects I have worked on include
                <a href="SmartWaterDistributionNetworks.html">smart water distribution networks</a>
